# Mechanical Engineer

## Experience
**Thermal Designer** | *Laird Technology Inc.* | June 2024 - September 2024, (3 Months)
- Performed thermal management for a 4kW charging station using Flotherm, selecting fans based on flow, pressure, heat loss, and TDP of electrons to maintain their temperatures between 20~55°C below the junction temperature at the simulation's converged state.
- Designed an airflow baffle based on the layout diagram and chassis structure, conducted electro-thermal-fluid coupling analyses on the optimized chassis, and achieved a 3% to 7.2% reduction in temperatures at electron and monitor points.
- Drafted the baffle in 2D sheet metal drawings, facilitated the transition to manufacturing, and finalized the PLM for the optimized air-cooled chassis.
  
**Application Engineer** | *Altair Engineering Inc. (Nasdaq: ALTR)* | September 2022 - September 2023, (13 Months)
- Conducted structural optimization on over 15 gearbox components using HyperMesh&OptiStruct, focusing on [<b><u>topology, shape, and free shape optimizations</u></b>](/Altair_Intern_Samples/Gearbox_Sample/Altair_1.md); collaborated with the Secondary Development team to automate optimization workflows and enhance debugging processes; produced comprehensive reports and manuals, achieving complete client satisfaction and securing a follow-up order for optimized gearbox NVH analysis.
- Performed a benchmarking analysis of SimSolid to OptiStruct and ANSYS Mechanical across various models, produced slides highlighting the advantages of mesh-free simulation technologies for sales, and delivered reports identifying issues for R&D teams and supervisors.
- Hosted training sessions and created [<b><u>video tutorials for SimSolid (Ver2022.2)</u></b>](/Altair_Intern_Samples/SimSolid_Tutorial_Sample/Altair_2.md), Inspire, SimSolid, Inspire, and Sulis (DfAM lattice structure and flow channel design), collaborated with sales to present functions of products, and provided training and technical support to pre-sale and post-sale clients.
- Served as a competition adjudicator of the 2022 Altair SimSolid Campaign, reviewed 80+ models from different industries, conducted multi-physics analysis and technical report on each model, expanded the foreign imagination of SimSolid, and explored potential customers for the marketing department.

**Assistant Designer** | *HE Intellegent Energy Inc.* | May 2020 - July 2020 (3 Months)
- Designed and assembled protective panels for the company's [<b><u>R410A air-cooled unit</u></b>](/HE_Intern_Samples/HE_1.md), tailored for the desert environment, significantly reducing finned heat exchanger clogging and potential damage from sand and catkins.
- Reconfigured the finned heat exchanger layout by replacing 3-row ⌀7 mm tubes with 4-row ⌀9.52 mm heat exchange tubes, increasing the heat exchange area by 25% while maintaining the designed spacing to delay frosting effectively.
- Enhanced the shell-and-tube heat exchanger by implementing inter/external threading on the tubes and increasing tube count from 120 to 160, and redesigned the plumbing layout configuration to fit, resulting in a nearly 30% increase in heat exchange area, a 10% efficiency boost theoretically, and a range of 0.9%-5.7% improvement in real-time C.O.P.
- Delivered the tender proposal for "200 Million Square-Meters Clean Energy and Geothermal Heating & Cooling Design, Management, Installation, and Operation Project", which was successfully commenced in Xinjiang, China, and the construction has been fully completed.

**Researcher** | *University of California, San Diego* | March 2022- August 2022
- Customized an in-house DLP printer and executed 3D bioprinting of cardiac patches using lab-developed bio-ink.
- Optimized printing parameters, including aperture and light intensity, and conducted mechanical testing to refine bio-ink formulation, improved tissue-matched mechanical properties and long-term integrity by 31%, in collaborating with nanotechnology and biomaterials researchers.
- Authored and submitted a proposal titled "3D Printed Cardiac Patch for Cardiac Tissue Vascular Regeneration".
