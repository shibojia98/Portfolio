# Mechanical Engineer

### Experience
**Technical Support** | *Altair Engineering Inc. (Nasdaq: ALTR)* | September 2022 - September 2023, (13 Months)
- Conducted optimization developments (topology, shape, and free shape optimization) using HyperMesh for a [<b><u>gearbox</u></b>](/Altair_Intern_Samples/Gearbox_Sample/Altair_1.md) and transmission system, covering components such as gears, drive shafts, planetary gears, and casings, and produced detailed reports that fully met client requirements and expectations;
- Performed a thorough comparison and evaluation of SimSolid (Altair's mesh-free FEA product) to HyperMesh, and ANSYS Mechanical across various models, produced slides to highlight the advantages of meshfree simulation technologies for sales, and delivered reports identifying its issues for R&D teams;
- Created complete sets of slides and [<b><u>video tutorials for training sessions of SimSolid (Ver2022.2)</u></b>](/Altair_Intern_Samples/SimSolid_Tutorial_Sample/Altair_2.md), Inspire, SimSolid, and Sulis (DfAM lattice structure and flow channel design), collaborated with sales to present functions of products, and provided training and technical support to pre-sale and post-sale clients;
- Served as a competition adjudicator of the 2022 Altair SimSolid Campaign (Region: Greater China), reviewed 80+ competition models from different industries, and delivered individual report slides for each model (across structural analysis, fatigue analysis, and thermal analysis), expanded the foreign imagination of SimSolid and explore potential customers for the marketing department.

**Assistant Designer** | *HE Intellegent Energy Inc.* | May 2020 - July 2020 (3 Months)
- Designed and assembled protective panels for the company's R410A air-cooled chiller unit using AutoCAD, tailored for the desert environment, significantly reducing finned heat exchanger clogging nad potential damage from sand and catkins;
- Reconfigured the internal unit layout and replaced 3-row ⌀7mm tubes with 4-row ⌀9.52mm tubes in shell and tube heat exchanger, increased the heat exchange area by 25% while maintaining the designed spacing to delay frosting effectively;
- Enhanced the shell-and-tube heat exchanger by implementing inter/external threading on the tubes and increasing tube counts from 120 to 160, resulting in a nearly 30% increase in heat exchange area, a 10% efficiency boost theoretically, and a range of 0.9%-5.7% improvement in real-time C.O.P.;
- Delivered the tender proposal for "200 Million Square-Meters Clean Energy and Geothermal Heating & Cooling Design, Management, Installation, and Operation Project", which was successfully commenced in Xinjiang, China, and the construction has been fully completed.

**Researcher** | *University of California, San Diego* | March 2022- August 2022
- Customized an in-house DLP printer and executed 3D bioprinting of cardiac patches using lab-developed bio-ink;
- Optimized printing parameters, including aperture and light intensity, and conducted mechanical testing to refine bio-ink formulation, improved tissue-matched mechanical properties and long-term integrity by 31%, in collaborating with nanotechnology and biomaterials researchers;
